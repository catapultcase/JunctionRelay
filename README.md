# Junction Relay

**Junction Relay** is an open-source modular platform for real-time device and sensor coordination. Built for rapid deployment via Docker, it features a robust `.NET 8` backend and a modern React frontend for managing dynamic layouts, sensor data flows, and device orchestration across smart infrastructure.

## üö¶ Overview

Junction Relay serves as a central hub for connected hardware‚Äîsensors, microcontrollers, and display screens. It manages real-time data collection, collation, routing, and visualization with minimal setup.

Originally designed to communicate with ESP32 devices, the system has evolved into a flexible backend-frontend stack deployable on everything from Raspberry Pi clusters to industrial-grade servers.

Most importantly, **Junction Relay connects seamlessly with existing services** like:

- üè† **Home Assistant**
- üñ•Ô∏è **LibreHardwareMonitor**
- üì° **MQTT Brokers**
- üìà **Uptime Kuma**
- üíª **Native Host Machine Sensors**

This allows you to **consolidate data** from your smart home, PC hardware, servers, and monitoring dashboards into a single orchestrated control interface.

## üîå ESP Device Protocols

Junction Relay supports a wide range of communication protocols to interact with ESP32-based devices. This gives you flexibility depending on your hardware setup and reliability requirements:

| Protocol                   | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üåê **Ethernet**           | Reliable and low-latency. Ideal for stationary or high-performance setups using devices like the WESP32. |
| üì∂ **Wi-Fi**              | Most common option. Easy to configure and works well for mobile or wireless sensor nodes. |
| üîå **COM / Serial**       | Direct USB or UART connection. Useful for debugging or permanent wired installations. |
| üîÑ **WebSockets**         | Full-duplex, low-latency communication with the backend. Perfect for real-time data and UI updates. |
| üåê **HTTP**               | Lightweight and easy to integrate. Devices can push or pull updates from RESTful endpoints. |
| üì° **MQTT**               | Publish/subscribe protocol for loosely coupled sensor networks. Compatible with external brokers. |

You can configure the protocol per device depending on its capabilities and purpose. Many devices support fallback modes (e.g. Wi-Fi ‚Üí Ethernet), and all communication methods can coexist within the same Junction Relay instance.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker Hub

You can now run Junction Relay instantly using the prebuilt image hosted on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name junctionrelay \
  -p 7180:7180 \
  catapultcase/junctionrelay:latest
```

This pulls the latest version of Junction Relay and exposes the web interface at [http://localhost:7180](http://localhost:7180).

üîó **Docker Hub:** [catapultcase/junctionrelay](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/catapultcase/junctionrelay)

> Tip: Add `--restart unless-stopped` to run it automatically after reboot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source (Optional)

Prefer to build it yourself? You can compile and run the backend and frontend locally:

### üß± 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catapultcase/JunctionRelay.git
cd JunctionRelay\JunctionRelay_Server
```

### üåê 2. Install frontend dependencies

The React-based Web UI is located in `junctionrelaywebui`. Before running the backend, install the required frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd junctionrelaywebui
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

> üí° This step ensures the frontend assets are built and available for the backend to serve.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Run the server

```bash
dotnet run
```

Once running, navigate to [http://localhost:7180](http://localhost:7180) to access the web interface.
